    "## BACKGROUND\n",
    "Phishing attacks are one of the most prevalent and damaging forms of cybercrime today. These attacks deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers by masquerading as legitimate websites. Despite growing awareness, phishing remains a major cybersecurity threat due to the increasing sophistication of attackers who craft URLs and websites that are difficult to distinguish from legitimate ones. The rapid growth of the internet and the ease of setting up fraudulent websites have made this problem even more critical, especially for organizations and individuals who rely heavily on online platforms."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Phishing attacks remain one of the most dangerous threats in the digital landscape, deceiving users into revealing sensitive information by imitating legitimate websites. Traditional anti-phishing solutions, such as blacklist-based systems, are often insufficient due to their inability to detect newly created phishing sites. This project seeks to address the problem of phishing detection by developing a machine learning model that leverages different features from URLs, including structural, domain-based, and behavioral characteristics, to distinguish phishing sites from legitimate ones. The goal is to achieve high accuracy and improve the generalizability of phishing detection models, providing a robust solution to combat emerging phishing threats in real-time."
